## Topic Summary
- Links Summary... 
Links are created using the <a> element. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLS. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
- Layout Summary... <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page. Pages can be fixed with length or liquid (stretchy) layouts. Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
