## Topic Summary 
- Forms summary... Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element. Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they selec are sent to the server. HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
- Lists, Tables and Forms summary... In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
- Events summary... Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
